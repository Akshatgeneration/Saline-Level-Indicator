# Saline-Level-Indicator

Saline Level Indicator is a smart healthcare device that monitors the weight of an IV saline bottle using a load cell and sends a Telegram alert to medical staff when the level drops below a set threshold. Built using an ESP32, it helps prevent dry-out or air entry into the patient's vein, improving safety in hospitals.
